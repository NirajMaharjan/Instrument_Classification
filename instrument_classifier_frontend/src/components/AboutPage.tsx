              <h2>The Cultural Significance of Nepali Music</h2>
              <div className="decorative-element" />
              <p>
                Traditional Nepali music is more than entertainment‚Äîit's the heartbeat of a civilization.
                For centuries, the diverse ethnic communities of Nepal have used music to preserve their
                stories, celebrate their traditions, and connect with the divine.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each instrument carries profound cultural meaning. The haunting melody of the Sarangi tells
                tales of love and loss in remote mountain villages. The rhythmic pulse of the Madal
                accompanies festivals that mark the changing seasons. The sacred tones of the Bansuri
                have guided meditation and spiritual practice for generations.
              </p>
              <p>
                These instruments are not merely objects‚Äîthey are living repositories of Nepali identity,
                passed down through generations of master craftsmen and musicians who have dedicated their
                lives to preserving this invaluable heritage.

              <p>
                TradInstrument.ai employs advanced machine learning algorithms specifically trained
                on thousands of hours of traditional Nepali music recordings. Our neural networks
                can distinguish the unique timbral characteristics of each instrument with remarkable
                accuracy.

                <li>
                  <strong>Spectral Analysis:</strong> We analyze the frequency spectrum of audio
                  to identify instrument-specific patterns
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Temporal Modeling:</strong> Our models understand how different instruments
                  behave over time during performance
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cultural Context:</strong> The AI is trained specifically on traditional
